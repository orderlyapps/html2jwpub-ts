MEDIA FILES FOLDER
==================

This folder should contain image files referenced in article-with-images.html.

Expected files (as referenced in the HTML):
- sample-image-1.jpg

You can replace these with your own image files or add the sample images mentioned above.

The converter will automatically detect all files in this folder and include them
in the .jwpub publication if they are referenced in the HTML file.

Supported formats:
- JPEG/JPG
- PNG
- GIF
- SVG
- Other common image formats

Note: Make sure the file names in this folder match exactly with the paths
referenced in the HTML file (case-sensitive).
